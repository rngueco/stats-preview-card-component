## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Mobile-first development. I'm getting the hang of it, but it was a bit tricky to think about Flexbox, how flex items should "unflex" for bigger screens. Ended up removing the flex wrapping for desktop version.
- Adding a color overlay to a background image.
